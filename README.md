This program contains the Seinfeld theme as part of its resources. I did not create this peice of music, so the credit for the creation of the song goes to the respective composer.

I will add a more in-depth description later. Please note however that the program is in development stages and is not stable, I am aware that the program has some issues and I will proactively try to resolve them.
